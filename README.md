# AdvDiversity
The Institute to Advance Diversity connects underrepresented minorities with mentorship for career advancement. The Insititue to Advance Diversity's code is an MVP and due to the proprietary nature of the code I will only provide code snippets of my contribution. This repository contains React and .NET code for the role based routes and the NewsLetter Templates feature I've implemented, and MS SQL tables and procs is provided as well.
